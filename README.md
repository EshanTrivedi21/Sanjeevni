# Sanjeevni-Digitalizing Health, Empowering Lives

## The problem Sanjeevni solves
The problem that we hope to resolve with our project is India's fragmented and unorganised healthcare system. This makes it impossible for the health ministry to manage residents and provide advantages like insurance, free health checks, subsidies, and effective vaccination distribution. Furthermore, the existing system lacks a consolidated platform for managing and storing personal health information, resulting in inefficiencies and a disrupted user experience.

Our goal is to create a health identity platform that would serve as a digital health passport for every Indian citizen. All of a user's personal health information will be stored on the platform. The portal will be a one-stop destination for all health-related information and services, including appointment scheduling, test report management, hospital/doctor visit monitoring, and health analytics. Authorised healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, and clinics, will have access to the platform and will be able to upload and update the user's information in real time. By giving healthcare practitioners real-time access to patient information, this will speed the appointment scheduling process and enhance patient outcomes.

In conclusion, by offering a centralised platform for managing individual health information, our health identity platform will address the issue of India's absence of a comprehensive health identification system. The platform will enhance patient outcomes, simplify appointment scheduling, and provide residents a complete picture of their health condition. This will be a huge step in making India's healthcare system more efficient and effective.

## Challenges we ran into
The first and the most basic challenge we faced was to curate and amplify the idea.

When we were researching about our idea and gathering stats we ran into many mishaps and roadblock One of the major roadblocks we faced during brainstorming was to gather stats of different developed and developing countries to list down points to cut short points and to manage all that info such that we could formulate all of that into one

As described our app consists of a large number Of information which requires flawless and break free development which was stressing at some point ... We tackled it by teamwork disturbing the backend frontend and dashboards size respectively solving each other's inconvenience and continuously contributing

Technical fatalities :- we ran into several technical mishaps and errors time by time where some were related to routing of all the pages and some were related to api keys GitHub merge conflicts, ngrok functioning. One of the major errors or roadblock we faced during development was dealing with deployment and publishment as we all were working on different pc with different frontend and backend cumulating all of that and then hosting them to run every route every .env keys perfectly also we would like to thank our mentor Mr. Vraj Desai for suggesting us railway.app. it eased our way and process of deployment and smoothed our flow
